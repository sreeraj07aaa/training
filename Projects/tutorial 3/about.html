      the presentation of your website: With CSS, you can control the visual
      appearance of your website. You can change the layout, colors, fonts, and
      more to create a unique and professional-looking website. Improve the user
      experience: By using CSS to create a responsive design, you can ensure
      that your website looks great on all devices, including smartphones,
      tablets, and desktop computers. Save time and effort: By separating the
      content of your web pages from their presentation, you can save time and
      effort when making changes to your website. Increase your employability:
      CSS is a valuable skill that many employers look for when hiring web
      developers. By learning CSS, you can increase your chances of finding a
