      The remarkably rare “hybrid” annular-total solar eclipse has now ended.
      The Ningaloo eclipse is called a hybrid eclipse because it appeared either
      as a total eclipse or an annular eclipse depending on where and when you
      viewed it. It is named “Ningaloo” after the western coast of Australia
      because that is was best visible.
