        "We will not send the whole 100,000 in one lot. But we considered the
        request due to crop damages caused by the monkeys in several parts of
        the country. They will not be taken from conserved areas. The focus will
        be only in the cultivation areas", Mr Samarasinghe told reporters.The
        toque macaque monkey is endemic to Sri Lanka and classified as
        endangered on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)
        red list. Last week, Sri Lanka's agriculture minister Mahinda Amaraweera
        said that China's request for 1,00,000 monkeys to be exhibited at over
        1,000 Chinese zoos could be considered. "They want these monkeys for
        their zoos," the minister was quoted as saying. Sri Lanka bans almost
        all live animal exports but the proposed sale comes at a time when the
        country is facing its worst-ever economic c risis.

          The vehicle carrying the soldiers - all of them from Rashtriya Rifles
          unit deployed for counterterror operations - was fired upon by the
          terrorists at around 3 pm and later caught fire due to a likely
          grenade attack, the Army said. The attack has come three months after
          the targeted attack on Hindu families in Rajouri. Seven people were
          killed and over a dozen were injured in the attacks. The perpetrators
          are still at large despite a massive security operation in the area to
          track them down. Police have said that the terrorists were Pakistani
          nationals.
