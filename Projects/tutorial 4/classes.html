        In communications and information processing, code is a system of rules
        to convert information—such as a letter, word, sound, image, or
        gesture—into another form, sometimes shortened or secret, for
        communication through a communication channel or storage in a storage
        medium. An early example is an invention of language, which enabled a
        person, through speech, to communicate what they thought, saw, heard, or
        felt to others.

        But speech limits the range of communication to the distance a voice can
        carry and limits the audience to those present when the speech is
        uttered. The invention of writing, which converted spoken language into
        visual symbols, extended the range of communication across space and
        time.

      <p class="process feedback">
        The process of encoding converts information from a source into symbols
        for communication or storage. Decoding is the reverse process,
        converting code symbols back into a form that the recipient understands,
        such as English or/and Spanish.
